- When a plan calls for multiple devices to be connected to one PoE/PoE+ switch, it’s necessary to ensure the total wattage required by the devices do not exceed the maximum wattage of the switch.
- This device has a  estimated power consumption of 31.5W max. It powers up as soon as the PoE powersupply is connected.
