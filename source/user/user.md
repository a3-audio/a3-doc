## A³ Core (The Sound Server)
[A³ Core](https://doc.a3-audio.com/user/a3core.html) processes analog audiosignals, calculates 3D audio spheres and is remote controlled by A³ Mix and A³ Motion (or any other OSC controller). A³ Core can handle a wide range of audio hardware to fit environments like Dante, MADI or any class-compliant.
