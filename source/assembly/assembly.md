## Hardware
A working prototype exists. We applied intensive stress tests by using 12V car hifi with 15 inch centered Downfire subwoofer and 5 JBL Control One satellites on stands. We put everything on a hand-wagon and played at 40°C on a summerday in a fieldtest. It works pretty well and meanwhile was a rocksolid and stable experience.
