# A³ Assembly overview
Working prototypes exists. We applied intensive stress tests by using 12V car hifi with 15 inch centered Downfire subwoofer and 5 JBL Control One satellites on stands. We put everything on a hand-wagon and played at 40°C on a summerday. It works pretty well and it was a rocksolid and stable experience.
True, at the moment we've just Minimum viable products and its not ready to sell yet.
