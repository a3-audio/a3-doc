## A³ Motion (The Motion Sampler)
[A³ Motion](https://a3-audio.github.io/a3-doc/user/a3motion.html) is a standalone OSC controller which works like a loopstation, but instead of audio it lets you sample and playback motion from a touchscreen.

## A³ Core (The Sound Server)
[A³ Core](https://a3-audio.github.io/a3-doc/user/a3core.html) processes analog audiosignals, calculates 3D audio spheres and is remote controlled by A³ Mix and A³ Motion (or any other OSC controller). A³ Core can handle a wide range of audio hardware to fit environments like Dante, MADI or any class-compliant.
