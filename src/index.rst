Introduction

Thanks for your interest in the AÂ³ system.

These docs are split in two sections:

- The first section is the `User <https://a3-audio.github.io/a3-doc/user/user.html>`_ section, where you will find an overview of basic functions and connections.

- The second section is the developer section wich is under heavy development and will probably never be completed. The developer section is splitted into three subsections: `Developer <https://a3-audio.github.io/a3-doc/development/developer.html>`_ (about code), `Assembly <https://a3-audio.github.io/a3-doc/assembly/assembly.html>`_ (about hardware), and `Configuration <https://a3-audio.github.io/a3-doc/configuration/configuration.html>`_ (about operation system).
